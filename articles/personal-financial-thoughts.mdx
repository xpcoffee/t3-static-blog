## Concepts

**Salary ratio**

- _salary ratio_ = _old salary_ / _new salary_
- When changing jobs, your salary ratio between previous and new jobs shows your difference in buying-power.
- Can be more useful than exchange rate when relocating to another country to get a sense for how expensive things are.
- Use alongside exchange rate and cost-of-living to get a sense for how a job in a new country will affect your buying-power.

**Restricted Stock Unit (RSU)**

An RSU is a stock unit (e.g. one AMZN stock) that has been set aside for you, but which will only be given to you later, based
on some conditions.

- When a stock is given to you, we say that a stock "vests".
- Often time and employment are the conditions for vesting e.g. your stock vests after 6 months if you still work for the company.
- These are often used as a mechanism for retention. You get given new sets of RSUs in such a way that you always have some stocks that you need to wait for.
  The fact that you will "lose" any RSUs that haven't yet vested at the time you leave.
  This kind of scheme is sometimes called "golden handcuffs".

**Stock options**

An "option" is an opportunity to buy or sell one unit of stock at a specific price.

- Options to buy company stock are sometimes given as employee remuneration instead of direct stock.
- Options still require the person to actually buy the stock, but at a price that may have been locked in at a previous time.
- The decision to buy the option is called "exercising" the option.
- Recieving options can have very different tax implications to e.g. RSUs since the person doesn't actually own the stock yet.
  In some cases it is possible to delay income taxes on options up until the moment where they are exercised.

**Takeaways from [Rich Dad Poor Dad - Robert T. Kiyosaki][2]**

**Real estate**

- The house you are living in is not an asset.
- Houses you own and are not yet fully paid are not assets.
- Rental income for houses that are _not_ yet fully paid is _not_ profit. It is a reduction on your mortgage payments.
- Rental income for houses that _are_ fully paid is not _necessarily_ profit. It is first a cover for maintenance.
- Better to buy than to rent (for the same property) in the long term.
- Better not to buy than to buy in the wrong location at the wrong time.
- Tension between the above two should guide when/where/how you buy.
- You get out what you put in; requires local knowledge, continuous attention, maintenance and re-investment.
- No one cares more about your investments than you.
- Water is the enemy. Insist on the highest standards for work that deals with it.
