[Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) is useful in pointing out that team/org structure strongly influence the structure of the systems and architectures we build.
We can use this knowledge to pro-actively structure teams to create communication structures that mimic our desired architecture.
We want changes in team structure to be feasible to do when we need, and we want this to be low cost.

In practice, I've seen some patterns which make it expensive, or even dangerous, to make changes to teams.

In this page I'm keeping track of these patterns, and alternatives which reduce/mitigate their negative side-effects.

## High-level

These high-level points are the basis for the rest of my current thoughts around this.

 - Restructuring teams is more expensive when team names/members/tools are strongly coupled to other parts of your system. Reducing coupling increases flexibility in team structure.
 - High-level product capabilities and domains have different lifecycles to teams. In general capabilities outlive individual teams.
 - Team structure and system structure only matters for engineers/technical roles; the rest of your company cares about capabilities more than org structure.

## Patterns & anti-patterns

### Organize around capabilities

Since stakeholders mainly care about capabilities, and that capabilities outlast team names, make them the anchor point for communications.

<div className="mt-8 text-lg"> ❌ **Don't do this.** </div>

In this example an organization is using team names as the anchor point for communication. This presents some problems:

 - stakeholders need to keep up to date with organizational changes around every capability they care about
 - stakeholders need to keep up to date implementation details (which service enables a capability), and then find a team that owns this capaibilty
 - similar names between teams can confuse communications
 - all of the above mean that a large amount of energy needs to be spent to educate stakeholders about team changes whenever they happen

<div className="mt-8 text-lg"> ✅ **Better.** </div>

![communications centered on capability](/images/capability-centered-communications.jpg)

Anchoring communications on capability improves on most of these painpoints and has some desirable properties:

 - Stakeholders do not need to know about either team names or how capabilities are implemented (e.g. which services exist).
 - Team names become non-critical; this makes them cheaper to change and enables them to be used e.g. for team culture/identity.
 - Moving capabilties between teams does not affect the rest of the system. That makes changes cheaper.
 - Focus on capabilities reduces the risk of having orphan capabilities, and gives a mechanism to describe the system's full feature set.

### Keep organization structure out of code

Your system code should describe domains/features/capabilities. You should avoid describing organization structure wherever possible.

<div className="mt-8 text-lg"> ❌ **Don't do this.** </div>

```java
com.mycompany.myorg.myteam.userservice;

class UserService { /* ... */};
```

This code:

 - Would need to be refactored the namespace when the team or org changes. These changes can introduce bugs.
Put another way, this system has a property that a change to a team name can potentially cause issues to their production service. This is a property we want to avoid.
 - If you _don't_ refactor/let the namespace become stale, then the namespaces become meaningless and potentially even confusing. Your code structure is working against you instead of helping you.


<div className="mt-8 text-lg"> ✅ **Better.** </div>

```java
com.myproduct.mydomain.mycapability.userservice;

class UserService { /* ... */};
```

This code:

 - Does not rely on organization structure. The owners of this code can be changed without needing to make changes to the code itself.
 - Organizes by domain and capabilities. This makes it possible for someone to find how a feature is implemented without needing to know about your organizational structure.
