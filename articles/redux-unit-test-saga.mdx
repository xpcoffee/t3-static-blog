[redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) is Redux middleware that provides functionality for <Link href={"/articles/redux-side-effects"}>executing side-effects in a React-Redux app</Link>.
While I've found sagas powerful to use, I initially found it difficult to unit-test their logic.

This article is a reference for the best approach I've found so far. I've added an example of this approach to [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/unit-testing-sagas-75l7n?file=/src/saga.ts); feel free to fork it and play around with it.

We will dive straight into the testing. If you are unfamiliar with redux-saga and function generators I recommend reading up on these topics first.
Here are some starting points:

- [function generators MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*)
- [redux-saga tutorial](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial)

**Example saga**

Let's define a toy saga that we can write some tests around test. It makes two remote calls, selects fields from the results and dispatches that information to the redux store.

```typescript
// saga.ts
import { call, put, takeEvery } from "redux-saga/effects"
import { fetchUser, fetchUserAttributes, UserAttributes } from "./api"

/**
 * Redux actions
 */
export const fetchUserDataAction = { type: "fetchUserData" }
export const updateUserData = (payload: { name: string } & UserAttributes) => ({
  type: "fetchUserData",
  payload,
})

/**
 * Defines the business logic of fetching user data
 */
export function* fetchUserData() {
  // fetch data
  const { id, name } = yield call(fetchUser)
  const { immunities } = yield call(fetchUserAttributes, id)

  // dispatch synchronous redux action to update app state
  yield put(updateUserData({ name, immunities }))
}

/**
 * Link business logic to a specific redux action
 */
export function* fetchUserDataOnAction() {
  yield takeEvery(fetchUserDataAction.type, fetchUserData)
}
```

## Testing sagas directly

We'll first start by understanding a direct approach to testing sagas.
It is the main approach that I've found when reading on how to test sagas online.

The concept of this approach is to directly step through saga functionality in your tests.
To understand what we're doing here, I've found useful is to think about function generators as iterators for steps in a workflow.

```javascript
function* fetchData() {
  const step = num => console.log("ran step: " + num)
  yield step(1)
  yield step(2)
  yield step(3)
}

const iterator = fetchData()

iterator.next()
// => ran step 1
iterator.next()
// => ran step 2
iterator.next()
// => ran step 3
```

We can do something similar in our tests to step through behaviour and run assertions on our sagas.

```typescript
// direct.test.ts
import { put } from "redux-saga/effects"
import { fetchUserData, updateUserData } from "./saga"

describe("fetchUserData", () => {
  it("calls APIs and updates state", () => {
    const iterator = fetchUserData()

    const name = "foo"
    const immunities = "bar"

    // should call /user
    iterator.next()
    const mockUserResponse = { id: "1234", name, immunities: undefined }

    // should call /userAttributes
    iterator.next(mockUserResponse) // pass mock response of previous step back to the saga
    const mockUserAttributeResponse = {
      id: undefined,
      name: undefined,
      immunities,
    }

    // should dispatch redux action with results
    const reduxAction = iterator.next(mockUserAttributeResponse).value
    expect(reduxAction).toEqual(put(updateUserData({ name, immunities })))
  })
})
```

The main benefit of this approach is that you can running the saga logic "raw" in our tests, with minimal setup.

However, I have had difficulty using this practically in my day-to-day work primarily because we need to know the internals of the saga in order to write the test.
Specifically, we need to know the order in which the saga will `yield` and to prepare and pass the correct parameters to each call to `next`.
This makes the test brittle; if we change the order of yields or add new behaviour in the saga without changing its contract, we still need to update our tests.

Another issue I have with this method is that we are invoking the saga differently to how we would in our actually code where we would be dispatching redux actions.

## Unit testing sagas

Ideally we should test our sagas according to their contract.
That means dispatching an action and validating that the saga results in the correct side-effects and changes to the store.

To allow this, we need some additional setup that takes away the need of manually invoking the saga and that allows us to dispatch actions.
Happily, all the needed functionality comes with `redux-saga` in the form of `channel`s and `runSaga`.

- `runSaga` does what its name implies: it handles running a saga you give it.
- A `channel` recieves and delivers Redux actions and can be passed to `runSaga`.
- We can also provide a `dispatch` to `runSaga` which it will call when sagas dispatch actions to the store.

<div className="mb-5"></div>

We can tie these three functionalities together in a test utility.

```typescript
import { Action } from "redux"
import { Saga, stdChannel, runSaga } from "redux-saga"

export const testRunSaga = <S extends Saga>(
  saga: S,
  ...params: Parameters<S>
) => {
  // channel to which events can be dispatched
  const channel = stdChannel()

  // a record of redux actions dispatched from the saga
  const dispatched: Action[] = []
  const dispatch = (action: Action) => dispatched.push(action)

  runSaga({ channel, dispatch }, saga, ...params)

  return { channel, dispatched }
}
```

<div className="mb-5"></div>

Using this utility, we can write a test that allows us to test a saga as a unit.

```typescript
// unit.test.ts
import * as api from "./api"
import {
  fetchUserDataAction,
  fetchUserDataOnAction,
  updateUserData,
} from "./saga"
import { testRunSaga } from "./testUtils"

// test data
const user: api.User = {
  name: "foo",
  id: "1234",
}
const userAttributes: api.UserAttributes = {
  immunities: "bar",
}

// mock out API integration
jest.spyOn(api, "fetchUser").mockImplementation(async () => user)
jest
  .spyOn(api, "fetchUserAttributes")
  .mockImplementation(async () => userAttributes)

describe("fetchUserDataOnAction", () => {
  it("should make expected calls and return data", async () => {
    const { channel, dispatched } = testRunSaga(fetchUserDataOnAction)

    // unit input: dispatch redux action
    channel.put(fetchUserDataAction)

    // let async run
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve))

    // unit output: assert correct resulting action has been dispatched to the store
    const expectedPutAction = updateUserData({
      name: user.name,
      ...userAttributes,
    })
    expect(dispatched).toContainEqual(expectedPutAction)
  })
})
```

<div className="mb-5"></div>

I much prefer this method. We invoke the saga using a similar contract to what we'd do in our implementation,
we don't need to care about the internals of the saga<super>\*</super>,
and we can make assertions based on its resultant side effects/return values.

In other words, we can now test our saga as a unit. This reduces brittleness, improves readability, and I find it easier to write.

Best of luck with your testing!

  <super>*</super> The saga is still performing side-effects, so we do still
  need to know about and mock out integrations e.g. our API calls.
