## What this is and why you should care

**The `this` keyword in JavaScript** is a reference to the ThisBinding. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="It references the object in which the function is defined if the function is a method; it references the global execution environment if the function is outside an object.">[The ThisBinding is updated dynamically by the interpreter.][this_binding_so]</span> The ThisBinding can allow functions to have access to scope that is outside of the function closure (e.g. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="This ability makes 'this' useful when working within objects. 'this' becomes analogous to what would be called 'private' or 'protected' scope in other languages.">other object attributes</span>).

**The `this` reference can be manipulated** for functions by using their `call`, `apply` and `bind` methods. Knowing how to use these opens up powerful ways to share functionality between classes and objects.

Here's a quick intro for each:

```javascript
/**
 * We define a function with logic that we want to share at runtime.
 */
function greet(name, surname) {
  console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${name} ${surname}! ${this.howAreYou}`)
}

/**
 * We define some objects that can make use of that functionality.
 */
const english = {
  greeting: "Good morning",
  howAreYou: "How are you?",
}

const french = {
  greeting: "Bonjour",
  howAreYou: "Comment allez-vous?",
}

const afrikaans = {
  greeting: "Gooie more",
  howAreYou: "Hoe gaan dit?",
}

/**
 * call -  Invokes the function directly.
 *
 * first param: the object that "this" should refer to
 * params thereafter: function parameters
 */
greet.call(english, "Tom", "Tomsington")

/**
 * apply - Invokes the method directly. It's very similar to the call method.
 *
 * first param: the object that "this" should refer to
 * second param: an array of function parameters
 */
greet.apply(french, ["Stephanie", "de Monaco"])

/** bind - Prepares the function, such that it can be called later.
 *
 * first param: the object that "this" should refer to
 * params thereafter: [optional] function parameters. This **partially** populates parameters. Useful when parameters don't change.
 */
const afrikaansGreeting = greet.bind(afrikaans, "Jaco")

// We can now call with the prepared function with the remaining parameters
afrikaansGreeting("van de Merwe")
afrikaansGreeting("van Niekerk")
afrikaansGreeting("van die Spruitriviersfontein")
```

## Practical example using bind

Here we'll look at a situation where manipulating `this` can be useful.

The core idea is that **returning a bound function** allows us to use methods of an object outside of those objects.

Usually, [closures capture scope which functions need][javascript_scope], but closures do not lock down what `this` refers to. Since `this` is frequently used within object methods, we need a method of binding `this` so that the method can still work even when it is passed around without its object.

```javascript
/** Class returning an unbound function **/
class Passerby {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
    console.log("Hello! I am " + this.name)
  }

  rememberMe() {
    // return a function making use of "this"
    return function () {
      console.log("I remember " + this.name + "!")
    }
  }
}
const rememberJohn = new Passerby("John").rememberMe()

try {
  /**
   * When we call the function here, the "this" reference has changed:
   * we no longer reference the object; instead we're referencing the
   * global execution context. There is no "name" in the global context,
   * so an error occurs.
   */
  rememberJohn()
} catch (e) {
  console.log("I can't quite recall who that was...")
}

/** Class returning a bound function **/
class Friend {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
    console.log("Hello! I am " + this.name)
  }

  // return a bound function making use of "this"
  rememberMe() {
    const remember = function () {
      console.log("I remember " + this.name + "!")
    }
    return remember.bind(this)
  }
}

const rememberEmily = new Friend("Emily").rememberMe()

try {
  /**
   * Because the function has been "bound" to our Friend object,
   * "this" still references "emily", and we can successfully log
   * out the name
   */
  rememberEmily()
} catch (e) {
  console.log("I can't quite recall who that was...")
}
```

## TODO

- Applying functions to objects you don't control
- Sharing methods with other objects
- Caveats - these methods can be strong vectors for the the [feature envy codesmell](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-smells/)
