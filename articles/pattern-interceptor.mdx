**TLDR** An "interceptor" is a <Link href="/articles/patterns">pattern</Link> which enables different operations to act in sequence on the same object.

## Problem/context

There are senarios when we need to run multiple process in series on an object and either make a decision or transform the object.
In these senarios, the processes may also need to be stateful.

An example of this senario is when handling requests in a webserver:
we may want to perform authentication, <Link href="/articles/load-shedding-throttling">request-throttling</Link> and authorization in that order for all requests.

## Concept

The core idea is to have a sequence of processes. Each process is defined in a class, allowing state to be kept per-process.
There is also a class which orchestrates the processes and handles errors/early returns from the sequence.

</figure>

**Key characteristics**

- There is a common interceptor interface which new interceptor classes must implement.
- There is an orchestrator class which contains the sequence of interceptors and which invokes them in sequence.
- There are a common set of responses that interceptors can return to allow the sequence to continue or which trigger an early return from the orchetrator.

## Examples

An interceptor chain which processes a web request.

```typescript
// Note: several class definitions have been left out for brevity

/**
 * Usage
 */
// 1. define interceptors
const interceptors = [
    new LoggingInterceptor(),
    new GlobalThrottlingInterceptor({
        throttlingPeriodInMillis: 1000
        throttlingRequestLimit: 5
    })
]

// 2. initialize the orchestrator
const orchestrator = new InterceptorOrchestrator({interceptors})

// 3. proccess requests
orchestrator.run(new Request())


/**
 * Definitions
 */
class InterceptorOrchestrator {
  private interceptors: Interceptor[];

  constructor({ interceptors }: { interceptors: Interceptor[] }) {
    this.interceptors = interceptors
  }

  run(request: Request): AppResponse {
      for(let interceptor in interceptors) {
          try {
            const interceptorResponse = interceptor.run(request);

            // early return
            if(!interceptorResponse.success) {
                return interceptorResponse;
            }
          } catch(e) {
              Logger.error(`Internal error when processing request. | Request: ${request} | Error: ${e}`)
              return new InternalErrorResponse();
          }
      }
  }
}

interface Interceptor {
    run: (request: Request) => AppResponse
}

// Debug-logs the request
class LoggingInterceptor {
    run(request: Request) {
        Logger.debug(request)
        return new SuccessResponse();
    }
}

// Keeps track of all requests in a time period
// and triggers early return if the request count is too high.
class GlobalThrottlingInterceptor {
    const requestCount = 0;
    const throttlingRequestLimit;

    constructor({throttlingRequestLimit, throttlingPeriodInMillis}: AppConfig) {
        this.throttlingRequestLimit = throttlingRequestLimit

        setTimeout(() => {
            this.requestCount = 0;
        }, throttlingPeriodInMillis)
    }

    run(request: Request) {
        this.requestCount++;
        if(requestCount > throttlingRequestLimit) {
            return new ThrottledResponse();
        }
        return new SuccessResponse();
    }
}
```
