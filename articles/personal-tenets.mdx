This is a personal list of [tenets](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tenet), which help me think through my priorities and help me make difficult decisions.

<span className="text-sm quicksand">
  I don't expect others to have the same priorities or make the same decisions.
  These tenets are specifically aimed at my personal strengths and weaknesses.
</span>

<div className="mb-8"></div>

<span className="text-sm quicksand">
  I want to stress that these help make tough decisions. They are less useful
  for situations where the choice or tradeoff is clear.

<h2 className="quicksand">Unless you know better, favour...</h2>

<Card heading="People over _">

Everything we do stems from people and is meant for people. Their needs take precedence.
Favour choices that empower, enable or elevate people over most other choices.

</Card>

<Card heading="Transparency over clarity">

If others know about your challenges, they can help you overcome them.
Favour communication choices that allow others to know what is going on over those that try to reduce noise.

</Card>

<Card heading="Momentum over correctness">

It is more important to keep moving than to guarantee correctness at every step. Favour the choice that builds more momentum.

</Card>

<Card heading="Learning over short-term success">

Sustainable success requires lessons to be learned and experience to be built up.
This is more important than continual short-term success.
Favour the choice that enables you to gather more knowledge.

</Card>

<Card heading="Feedback over intuition">

You can't build a successful business without exposing yourself to customer feedback.
Favour the choice that gives more exposure to that feedback.

</Card>

<Card heading="Iteration over polish">

Building the right thing in the long term requires iterating on product decisions.
Favour the choice that allows you to try something new with the product over polishing an existing feature.

</Card>

<Card heading="Delivery over control">

We can't scale by trying to do everything ourselves.
Favour the choice that maximises delivery over the one that maximises your ability to control details.
